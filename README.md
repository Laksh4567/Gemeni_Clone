# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To start the program:
1) Open the terminal
2) Go to the required folder
3) Update the apiKey in the Gemeni.js file as I have removed the key due to constant 429 errors, kindly use your own api keys.
4) Type : ```npm install```
5) then type : ```npm run dev``` to start the server
6) Copy paste the local hoste server into the browser to see the website

NOTE: The web-deployed version won't answer any questions, as I removed my API key from it, to make it run kindly update the apiKey in the gemeni.js file
   Web deployed version: https://modifiedtailwind--anubhavgemeniclone.netlify.app/
